# Title:
Barcode scanner system for class and exam registration

# Problem Statement: 
The current way class and exam registration is done in SALCC has been proven to be largely ineffective, seeing as they rely on methods such as paper registers and roll calls. Methods like these are time consuming and prone to errors in record keeping, while also burdening one with a higher workload and making it difficult to retrieve records quickly. A move to a more automated system makes sense to improve accuracy and data management.

# Project Overview:
This project proposes to create a barcode based system using the barcode on the back of the student IDs for class and exam registration. Students can scan their IDs on the barcode scanner upon entering, in which the system will automatically record the attendance within the system. Barcode scanning was chosen because it is quick, reliable, cheap and integrates easily with the pre-existing barcodes on the student IDs. The project will focus on making a physical prototype and a software for the reader to demonstrate how this can be accomplished. 

# Project Format:
Prototype and application development.

# Project Scope:
Use existing barcodes from student ids.
Design the systems architecture.
Develop the barcode scanner prototype and application.
Design database tables for attendance records.
Implement real time logging.
Develop reporting and security features/measures.
Test the system’s accuracy and functionality regularly.
(Make a proper user interface if absolutely needed)
